# countdown

countdown is a jQuery plugin to render countdowns. Instead of unicorns this plugin does not have any magic, but if you like countdowns to be rendered the way you want, this plugin might become your best friend.
Done by Robert Fleischmann thanks to him !

## My version

Just made an example for a countdown that reset every friday.
Just check comments on code to customize for your needs 
(suitable if you have a  shop that resets every friday / or to reset your website every friday etc..)
